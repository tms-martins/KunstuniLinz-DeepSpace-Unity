      content for the Kunstuni Linz Deep Space, including TUIO protocol cursor tracking.

    text: 1) Make a copy of the scene "Starter - Deep Space - Wall, Floor and UI
      (dual displays)" and start from there.
    linkText:

  - heading: 
    text: 2) Typically, the DeepSpace is configured as two separate displays, so
      each Camera in the scene is set to render to a different display. To preview
      both the wall and the floor, you may want to have two Game tabs, one set to
      "Display 1" and the other to "Display 2" and stack them vertically. Each Game
      tab should be set to an aspect of 16:9, or a fixed resolution of 4K 3840x2160
      (DeepSpace single display); or 1920x1080 (half of that) on less powerful computers.

    text: '3) In Project Settings > Player > Resolution and Presentation, make sure
      "Run in Background" is checked, so that the Editor still runs while you are
      working on a nother window, e.g. a TUIO simulator. - The on-screen Log UI can
      be toggled with the "L" key. '

    text: '5) De-activate or delete the Game Objects you won''t use. However, even
      if you only want to work with wall visuals, keeping "Floor UI" and "Floor Camera"
      can be useful for visual feedback while creating and testing. '

    text: 6) What your cursors look like and what they do depends on the prefab assigned
      in each Deep Space Cursor Manager in the scene. The cursors move in X and Y
      in relation to their parent Transform, as set in each Deep Space Cursor Manager.

    text: '7) When running in the Editor, a Deep Space Settings Loader component
      loads settings from an asset assigned to it. '

  - heading: 
    text: 8) When you build and run the application, the Deep Space Settings Loader
      will instead look for a settings file in "[Application name]_Data\Settings\DeepSpaceSettings.txt"
      relative to the executable file. An example settings file is provided for you
      to use.

  - heading: About This Project
    text: "This Unity project was created by Tiago Martins, with reference to an
      example kindly provided by Axel Br\xE4uer, and a few test runs in the actual
      space with feedback from Holunder Hei\xDF. OSC code is heavily based on UnityOSC
      by Thomas Fredericks (link below)."

  - heading: 
    text: The project was created in Unity 2021.3 starting from the base 3D template,
      and then adding the URP. It should be possible to open the project with later
      versions of the Editor; and it should be straightforward enough to recreate
      the project for earlier versions of the editor, or to use the built-in renderer
      or HDRP. The code should be version-independent in principle. Assets include
      materials and textures from the free Gridbox Prototype Materials package by
      Cyathiza (link below).
