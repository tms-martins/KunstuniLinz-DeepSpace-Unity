    text: '1) Make a copy of the starter scene "Starter - Deep Space - Wall, Floor
      and UI (dual displays)" and start from there. '
    linkText: 
    url: 
  - heading: 
    text: '2) Typically, the DeepSpace is configured as two separate displays, so
      each Camera in the scene is set to render to a different display. To preview
      both the wall and the floor, you may want to have two Game tabs, one set to
      "Display 1" and the other to "Display 2" and stack them vertically. Each Game
      tab should be set to an aspect of 16:9, or a fixed resolution of 3840x2160
      (DeepSpace single display); or 1920x1080 (half of that) on less powerful computers.  '

  - heading: 
    text: '3) In Project Settings > Player > Resolution and Presentation, make sure
      "Run in Background" is checked, so that the Editor still runs while you are
      working on a nother window, e.g. a TUIO simulator. - The on-screen Log UI can
      be toggled with the "L" key. '

    text: '4) De-activate or delete the Game Objects you won''t use. However, even
      if you only want to work with wall visuals, keeping "Floor UI" and "Floor Camera"
      can be useful for visual feedback while creating and testing. '

    text: '5) When you build and run the application, it will look for a settings
      file in "[Application name]_Data\Settings\DeepSpaceSettings.txt" relative to
      the executable file. An example settings file is provided for you to use. '

  - heading: About This Project
    text: "This Unity project was created by Tiago Martins, with reference to an
      example kindly provided by Axel Br\xE4uer, and a few test runs in the actual
      space with feedback from Holunder Hei\xDF. OSC code is heavily based on UnityOSC
      by Thomas Fredericks. Feel free to modify and use. If you use it for commercial
      purposes, please be so kind to credit us and also let us know if possible."

  - heading: 
    text: The project was created in Unity 2022.3 starting from the URP template.
      It should be easy enough to recreate the project for earlier versions of the
      editor. The code should be version-independent in principle. Assets include
      materials and textures from the free Gridbox Prototype Materials package by
      Cyathiza (link below).
